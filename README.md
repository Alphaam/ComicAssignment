### Project Name: Spooky Night

Project Description: 

The project is a  a comic within a comic done through the narrative of a flipped script where on halloween it's finally the ghosts' turn to make fun of humans. The first layer of the comic is created by the ghosts characters interracting with each other and the user observing their interraction and dynamic as they are exposed to different human jokes. The second layer is created by the jokes being expressed as a comical narrative with human characters. In the human layer of the comic, four characters are struggling with enterprenourial endevours and failing quite comedically.  

The overall theme is halloween in the ghost world. The theme is created by using conventional halloween palletes, stereotypical halloween objects(pumpkins, ghosts, voodoo dolls). An added theme was unrelenting, inescapable cringe. We strived to create an experience that was hard to go through because the content was cringey but still instilling a desire to keep going in the user. How we accomplished the cringe element was by having a series of really cringey jokes. This element coupled with unpredicatable illustartions accomplished the intetnion of keeping the user hooked.


Process: 

The implementation of the concept aesthetically was accomplished by creating hand sketched ellements that would be used on the webpage. The fact that all the elements were hand sketched created a lot of room for intention in designing the characters that would affect the overalll feel of the comic. Very specific color palettes were used, varying sketching styles for characters and objects based on which world they were in(human or ghost) to create contextual distinction. Furthermore, intentional design of how all these objects interracted with each other at each stage of the comic to avoid a redundant feel as well as to capture the tone and pace of the section that the objects were in based on the joke.


Reflection/Evaluation: 


The initial goal of the comic was to simply tell an entertaining story, whatever form that took. Because of this, there was no specific end vision for the project but rather a vision for the process. The intention for the process was for it to be inclusinve of as many ideas as possible and challenging ourselves to encorporate as much as we could to the story while observing McClouds's guidance. All these expectations were met quite successfully.
